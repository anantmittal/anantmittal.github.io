								Depression is one of the most common challenges that patients with cancer face during
								and after treatment, and many patients with cancer and depression do not receive
								adequate psychosocial treatment. Although prior research has found collaborative care
								management to be effective for patients with cancer and depression, additional work has
								highlighted communication and collaboration challenges between patients and providers in
								navigating the parallel cancer care and psychosocial care journeys of these patients. We
								designed and developed SCOPE (Supporting Collaborative Care to Optimize Psychosocial
								Engagement), a platform supporting technology-enhanced collaborative care management for
								patients with cancer and depression. SCOPE combines a patient-facing mobile app with a
								provider-facing registry, with key features including support for patient assessments,
								for behavioral activation, and for directly integrating patient-generated data into the
								provider registry. We examined how SCOPE supports collaborative care through real-world
								clinical deployment in 6 cancer clinics and through 44 interviews with patients and
								providers. We found that (1) SCOPE improved collaboration by making patients feel
								connected to their care team, (2) patients needed support for taking action, for
								self-reflection, and for sensemaking, and they sought recognition and emotional support
								with their generated health data, (3) SCOPE improved provider perception of care and of
								care team collaboration. We conclude with design opportunities and implementation
								challenges for future technology-enhanced collaborative care systems in clinical
								contexts.

								Self-tracking and personal informatics offer important potential in chronic condition
								management, but such potential is often undermined by difficulty in aligning
								self-tracking tools to an individual's goals. Informed by prior proposals of
								goal-directed tracking, we designed and developed MigraineTracker, a prototype app that
								emphasizes explicit expression of goals for migraine-related selftracking. We then
								examined migraine patient experiences in a deployment study for an average of 12+
								months, including a total of 50 interview sessions with 10 patients working with 3
								different clinicians. Patients were able to express multiple types of goals, evolve
								their goals over time, align tracking to their goals, personalize their tracking,
								reflect in the context of their goals, and gain insights that enabled understanding,
								communication, and action. We discuss how these results highlight the importance of
								accounting for distinct and concurrent goals in personal informatics together with
								implications for the design of future goal-directed personal informatics tools.

								Persons with fibromyalgia experience a diverse set of symptoms. Recommendations for
								management generally focus on multidisciplinary approaches involving multiple
								modalities. Mobile apps can be an essential component for self-management, yet little is
								known about how persons with fibromyalgia use mobile apps for health-related purposes. A
								cross-sectional survey (N=663) was conducted to understand the real-world use of apps
								among persons with fibromyalgia. The survey included two main foci: 1) eHealth literacy
								and use of information sources, and 2) mobile app use patterns and preferences for
								health-related purposes, including the types of apps used and usage characteristics of
								apps that they used, as well as those that they had discontinued. Respondents’ average
								eHealth literacy as measured by eHEALS was 31.4 (SD=7.1), and they utilized diverse
								information sources. Approximately two-thirds of the sample used mobile apps; the
								remaining one-third did not. Diverse health management needs were represented in the
								apps reported, including scheduling/time management, notetaking, fitness, and wellness.
								Compared to apps that had been discontinued, participants rated apps that they still
								used higher in terms of ease of use and used them more frequently. Reasons for
								discontinuing app use included issues with privacy, the effort required, lack of
								interest, and lack of perceived quality. Other reasons for app non-use were lack of
								awareness and how-to knowledge, indicating that disseminating information about apps and
								addressing other barriers, such as providing user support, are critical to increasing
								uptake. These study findings can inform both app design and dissemination.

								Videoconferencing usage has surged in recent years, but current platforms present
								significant accessibility barriers for the 430 million d/Deaf or hard of hearing people
								worldwide. Informed by prior work examining accessibility barriers in current
								videoconferencing platforms, we designed and developed <em>Jod</em>, a videoconferencing
								platform to facilitate communication in mixed hearing groups. Key features include
								support for customizing visual layouts and a notification system to request attention
								and influence behavior. Using <em>Jod</em>, we conducted six mixed hearing group
								sessions with 34 participants, including 18 d/Deaf or hard of hearing participants, 10
								hearing participants, and 6 sign language interpreters. We found participants engaged in
								visual layout rearrangements based on their hearing ability and dynamically adapted to
								the changing group communication context, and that notifications were useful but raised
								a need for designs to cause fewer interruptions. We provide insights for future
								videoconferencing designs and conclude with recommendations for conducting mixed hearing
								studies.

								The UW SCOPE study (Supporting Collaborative Care to Optimize Psychosocial Engagement in
								the Cancer Setting) is designing and developing a new web-based patient-provider
								platform for technology-enhanced Collaborative Care Management of depression in urban
								and rural cancer centers. The platform is currently deployed as part of a pragmatic
								effectiveness-implementation trial of technology-enhanced Collaborative Care vs. Usual
								Collaborative Care. This position paper for the CHI 2023 Workshop on Bridging HCI and
								Implementation Science introduces our setting of patients with cancer and depression,
								reviews our human-centered design of SCOPE, and reflects on our experiences with SCOPE
								as a case study at the intersection of human-centered design and implementation science.

								Effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team
								member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Computational notebooks
								give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of
								the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text,
								visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing
								in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to
								working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data
								scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data
								science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in
								pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on
								either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a
								collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks
								improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and
								reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead
								to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination.
								The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and
								clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications
								aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus
								improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.

								Unlike general learning management systems which have used fine-grained trace behaviours
								to understand learning processes, data science environments use discipline-specific
								tools such as Project Jupyter (Perez and Granger, 2015). Augmentation of these tools is
								necessary in order to surface learner activities in ways which might be used for
								adaptation (Ferguson, 2012). This is analogous to augmenting problem-solving
								environments for mathematics (Melis and Siekmann, 2004), where domain-specific tools are
								necessary for understanding learning activity. In this work, we specifically tackle the
								augmentation of Project Jupyter. We explain the architecture of the environment along
								with the types of events we are able to collect and frame research questions we aim to
								answer with this work.
