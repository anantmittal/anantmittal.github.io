                                Videoconferencing usage has surged in recent
                                years, but current platforms present significant
                                accessibility barriers for the 430 million
                                d/Deaf or hard of hearing people worldwide.
                                Informed by prior work examining accessibility
                                barriers in current videoconferencing platforms,
                                we designed and developed <em>Jod</em>, a
                                videoconferencing platform to facilitate
                                communication in mixed hearing groups. Key
                                features include support for customizing visual
                                layouts and a notification system to request
                                attention and influence behavior. Using
                                <em>Jod</em>, we conducted six mixed hearing
                                group sessions with 34 participants, including
                                18 d/Deaf or hard of hearing participants, 10
                                hearing participants, and 6 sign language
                                interpreters. We found participants engaged in
                                visual layout rearrangements based on their
                                hearing ability and dynamically adapted to the
                                changing group communication context, and that
                                notifications were useful but raised a need for
                                designs to cause fewer interruptions. We provide
                                insights for future videoconferencing designs
                                and conclude with recommendations for conducting
                                mixed hearing studies.

                                Effective collaboration in data science can
                                leverage domain expertise from each team member
                                and thus improve the quality and efficiency of
                                the work. Computational notebooks give data
                                scientists a convenient interactive solution for
                                sharing and keeping track of the data
                                exploration process through a combination of
                                code, narrative text, visualizations, and other
                                rich media. In this paper, we report how
                                synchronous editing in computational notebooks
                                changes the way data scientists work together
                                compared to working on individual notebooks. We
                                first conducted a formative survey with 195 data
                                scientists to understand their past experience
                                with collaboration in the context of data
                                science. Next, we carried out an observational
                                study of 24 data scientists working in pairs
                                remotely to solve a typical data science
                                predictive modeling problem, working on either
                                notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or
                                individual notebooks in a collaborative setting.
                                The study showed that working on the synchronous
                                notebooks improves collaboration by creating a
                                shared context, encouraging more exploration,
                                and reducing communication costs. However, the
                                current synchronous editing features may lead to
                                unbalanced participation and activity
                                interference without strategic coordination. The
                                synchronous notebooks may also amplify the
                                tension between quick exploration and clear
                                explanations. Building on these findings, we
                                propose several design implications aimed at
                                better supporting collaborative editing in
                                computational notebooks, and thus improving
                                efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.
