			I am a Ph.D. student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science
			& Engineering, University of Washington, currently affiliated with
			the
			<strong>
				<a href="http://centerforgamescience.org/" target="_blank"
					>Center for Game Science</a
				>
			</strong>
			and closely collaborating with education researchers at
			<strong>
				<a href="https://www.enlearn.org/" target="_blank"
					>Enlearn
				</a> </strong
			>.

			At UW, my research has been at the intersection of human-computer
			interaction, cognitive psychology, learning sciences, and applied
			artificial intelligence. Using concepts from these fields, I try to
			build personalized and interactive

			</strong>
			systems for classroom environments. I also built
			data science pipelines to generate interactive lessons that

			players.

			Previously, as a graduate student at the University of Michigan I worked with
			Prof. Christopher Brooks at the
			<strong>
				<a href="https://edtech.labs.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank">
					Educational Technology Collective lab.
				</a>
			</strong>
			I built the first extensions for Project Jupyter to capture learning behavior of data science students on Coursera. Additionally, I engineered an entire infrastructure around Jupyter notebooks to crowdsource data science questions and datasets.

			I have been fortunate to be affiliated with the following
			organizations in my career:
