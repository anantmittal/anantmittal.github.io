			I am a Ph.D. student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science
			& Engineering, University of Washington, currently affiliated with
			the
			<a href="http://centerforgamescience.org/" target="_blank"
				>Center for Game Science</a

			and closely collaborating with education researchers at

			At UW, my research has been at the intersection of human-computer
			interaction, cognitive psychology, learning sciences, and applied
			artificial intelligence. Using concepts from these fields, I try to
			build personalized and interactive math learning systems for
			classroom environments.

		<p>
			I also spent some time building data science pipelines to generate
			interactive lessons for improving neuron tracing behavior of
