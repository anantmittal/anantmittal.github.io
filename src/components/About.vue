			I am a Ph.D. student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science
			& Engineering, University of Washington, currently affiliated with
			the
			<a href="http://centerforgamescience.org/" target="_blank"
				>Center for Game Science</a
			>
			and closely collaborating with education researchers at
			<a href="https://www.enlearn.org/" target="_blank">Enlearn</a>. My
			research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction,
			cognitive psychology, learning sciences, and applied artificial
			intelligence. Using concepts from these fields, I try to build
			personalized and interactive math learning systems for classroom
			environments.
