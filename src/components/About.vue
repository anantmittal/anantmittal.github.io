			I am a Ph.D. student at the Paul G. Allen School of <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science
			& Engineering</a>, University of Washington (UW), advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/" target="_blank">Prof. James Fogarty</a>. My research interests are in building interactive systems and evaluating them through mixed-methods. I've built systems for accessibility, health, and education.

			<strong>Projects:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://sites.uw.edu/scopestudy/">Project SCOPE</a> - where we built a collaborative care system for people with cancer to manage their treatment and depression. <br/>Advisors: James Fogarty and Gary Hsieh, University of Washington <br/><strong>UW SCOPE: Examining Technology-Enhanced
Collaborative Care Management of Depression in the Cancer Setting, CHI 2023 Workshop on Bridging HCI and
Implementation Science <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anmittal/UWSCOPE_CHI_2023_Workshop.pdf">[pdf]</a></strong></li>
				<li>Accessible Video Conferencing Platform for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Community <br/>Advisors: Mohit Jain and Pratyush Kumar, Microsoft Research India</li>
				<li>Understanding Mobile App Needs for Patients with Fibromyalgia<br/>Advisors: Annie T. Chen (UW) and Yan Zhang (University of Texas Austin)</li>

		<p> Previously at UW, I was advised by Prof. Zoran PopoviÄ‡ as part of the
			<strong>

					>Center for Game Science</a
				>
			</strong>
			and	<strong>
				<a href="https://www.enlearn.org/" target="_blank">Enlearn</a>
			</strong>. I designed and developed personalized interactive

			</strong>
			systems for classroom environments. I also built
			data science pipelines to generate interactive lessons that

			players.

			As a graduate student at the University of Michigan, School of Information I worked with
			Prof. Christopher Brooks at the
			<strong>
				<a href="https://edtech.labs.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank">
					Educational Technology Collective lab.
				</a>
			</strong>
			I built the first extensions for Project Jupyter to capture learning behavior of data science students on Coursera. I engineered an entire infrastructure around Jupyter notebooks to crowdsource data science questions and datasets.

			I have been fortunate to work in education, health, governance, and public policy through affiliations with the following organizations:
			<ul>
				<li>AdmitHub, now <a href="https://www.mainstay.com/" target="_blank">Mainstay</a></li>
