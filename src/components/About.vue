			I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the Paul G. Allen School of <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science
			& Engineering</a>, University of Washington, advised by <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/" target="_blank">Prof. James Fogarty</a>. My research interests are in HCI and applied data science for healthcare. <strong>I want to build systems</strong> that help people manage chronic conditions in clinical and personal care settings.
		</p>
		<p> Previously at UW, I was advised by Prof. Zoran PopoviÄ‡ as part of the
			<strong>
				<a href="http://centerforgamescience.org/" target="_blank"
					>Center for Game Science</a
				>
			</strong>
			and	<strong>
				<a href="https://www.enlearn.org/" target="_blank">Enlearn</a>
			</strong>. I designed and developed personalized interactive

			</strong>
			systems for classroom environments. I also built
			data science pipelines to generate interactive lessons that

			players.

			As a graduate student at the University of Michigan, School of Information I worked with
			Prof. Christopher Brooks at the
			<strong>
				<a href="https://edtech.labs.si.umich.edu/" target="_blank">
					Educational Technology Collective lab.
				</a>
			</strong>
			I built the first extensions for Project Jupyter to capture learning behavior of data science students on Coursera. I engineered an entire infrastructure around Jupyter notebooks to crowdsource data science questions and datasets.
		</p>

			I have been fortunate to work in education, health, governance, and public policy through affiliations with the following organizations:
			<ul>
				<li>AdmitHub, now <a href="https://www.mainstay.com/" target="_blank">Mainstay</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://aamaadmiparty.org/" target="_blank">Aam Aadmi Party, Delhi</a></li>
