The survey included two main foci: 1) eHealth literacy and use of information sources, and 2) mobile app use patterns and preferences for health-related purposes, including the types of apps used and usage characteristics of apps that they used, as well as those that they had discontinued. Respondents’ average eHealth literacy as measured by eHEALS was 31.4 (SD=7.1), and they utilized diverse information sources. Approximately two-thirds of the sample used mobile apps; the remaining one-third did not. Diverse health management needs were represented in the apps reported, including scheduling/time management, notetaking, fitness, and wellness. Compared to apps that had been discontinued, participants rated apps that they still used higher in terms of ease of use and used them more frequently. Reasons for discontinuing app use included issues with privacy, the effort required, lack of interest, and lack of perceived quality. Other reasons for app non-use were lack of awareness and how-to knowledge, indicating that disseminating information about apps and addressing other barriers, such as providing user support, are critical to increasing uptake.

In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.
